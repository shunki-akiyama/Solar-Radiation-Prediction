# Project Description
The purpose of this project is to analyze what factors affect the amount of solar radiation in general. 
The dataset used in this project is originally provided by NASA and it contains solar radiation and some weather information. 
It is critical for us to know how to predict solar power generation because we need to rely on clean energy more in the future. 
In this analysis, we will look at four months' data and figure out the correlation between variables.
The report is located in Report_Solar Radiation Prediction.pdf, the r script used in my analysis can be found under Solar Radiation Prediction.R file, and the dataset can be found under SolarPrediction.csv.
